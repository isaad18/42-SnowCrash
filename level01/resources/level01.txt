cat /etc/passwd
I found that I have read permission, and there is password hash for user flag01

4hDRfypTqqnw

after cracking this password using john tool

echo 4hDRfypTqqnw > hash.txt
john hash.txt

john --show hash.txt
?:abcdefg


found that the weak password of level01 is abcdefg which is very easy to crack it's was hashed using DES 128/128 hash
then 
su flag01
abcdefg
then 
getflag
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
