level03 executable

by analyzing the strings in level03 execultable
using the command (strings level03)

we found that the execultable is using this command
/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me

found that the line above is being executed with excalated privileges

so I thought about a trickto make it execute getflag instead of echo
so I created new dir inside tmp called it antother_bin, then created a file called echo that executed getflag, 
then updated the path to include the another_bin first, so that when echo is called, the first place it will search in is the another_bin, and it will execute the spoofed echo

export PATH=/tmp/another:$PATH

./level03 getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
